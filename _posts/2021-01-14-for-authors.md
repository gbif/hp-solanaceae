Thanks to the hard work of Jennifer Poore, with the assistance of Ellen Dean and Lynn Bohs, the descriptions of the 49 species (and 4 infraspecific taxa) of Lycianthes treated in the recent monograph of the group from Mexico and Central America are all now on the website. This represents the first real expansion of the description base on the site from Solanum.
