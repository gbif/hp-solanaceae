## Diversity of Solanaceae


Although very important commercially, the family is only a medium-sized one with approximately 90 genera and 3000-4000 species. However, members of the Solanaceae are extremely diverse in terms of habit, morphology, and ecology, ranging from trees or shrubs to vines, lianas, epiphytes, and annual herbs. Morphologically they show astounding variation in many flower and fruit characteristics.
