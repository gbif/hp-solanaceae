## Welcome to Solanaceae Source

Solanaceae Source aims to provide a worldwide taxonomic monograph of the nightshade family whose species that are used as food (potatoes, tomatoes and eggplants), medicines (henbane and deadly nightshades) and in horticulture (petunias). We began this journey with the on-line monograph of all species in the mega-diverse genus Solanum. The National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the Solanum project as part of the [Planetary Biodiversity Inventories](https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=103065#:~:text=The%20Planetary%20Biodiversity%20Inventory%20is,and%20the%20National%20Science%20Foundation.&text=The%20U.S.%20National%20Science%20Foundation,fields%20of%20science%20and%20engineering).
